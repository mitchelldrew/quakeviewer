- Retrofit allows your HTTP client to be defined as an interface. Great for unit testing.
- Dagger generates object graph boiler plate that allows you to write clear and concise single responsibility code with interface defined dependencies. Great for unit testing.
- RxJava/RxAndroid provides a powerful and scalable threading model and its event driven paradigm is well suited to mobile clients. Easy to unit test.
- Gson works great with Retrofit.

- I tried to get rid of the getColor deprecation warnings but I wouldnt be able to support API19 otherwise.
